This article talks about how 'DevOps for Dummies' author, Emily Freeman, has introduced a new model for modern software development. Freeman believes that it is her duty to create a new model that challenges the current status quo and accurately reflects the complexity of modern socio-technical systems. She believes that DevOps needs to change after so much time and focus less on unrealistic simplicity. Freeman states that her new revolutionary model is better representative of of the modern SDLC than the traditional models.

I find this article very interesting as this article is heavily related to the syllabus for this course, with its topic of DevOps. In addition, it highlights a new potential progression in this field for every programmer if this new model ends up successful and satisfactory for usage. As a result, I am interested to see where Freeman and her model will end up going.
